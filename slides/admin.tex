	\textbf{Extracting value from data}

	Ankit - student in 2010 - now at Oneira Corporation (Oakville):
	\begin{itemize}
		\item	\emph{Now, having worked for over a year, I find myself referring back to my notes all the time and appreciating the concepts about how to look at data and represent the data in the best possible manner, especially since on a daily basis I look at a gigantic amount of data and am required to make sense of it.}
	\end{itemize}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item	\emph{I think what I loved most about the course was the emphasis on the} \textbf{\emph{thinking}} \emph{and} \textbf{\emph{process of getting to a solution}} \emph{instead of the the final solution itself which has been an important attribute to becoming a good engineer or a problem solver/troubleshooter.}

	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{\imagedir/mindmaps/latent-variable-modelling-simple.png}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Enrichment topics that will be interspersed}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item	robust methods
		\item	cross-validation
		\item	nonparametric methods
		\item	real-time applications of statistical methods
		\item	missing data handling
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{What our grading philosophy is}
	What we look for in the grading is demonstration that you/group:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item	understand the concept,
		\item	have the ability to apply the concept to new instances,
		\item	think creatively about problems,
		\item	my questions are seldom ``plug-and-chug'',
		\item	numerical accuracy,
		\item	grammar and spelling.
	\end{enumerate}

	\vspace{12pt}
	Not all questions will be engineering related:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item	mostly (chemical) engineering questions
		\item	but also expect: current world events, public policy, bioengineering, anywhere there are data to analyze
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Grading policy in this course}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item	\emph{Appropriate} group work is highly encouraged
		\begin{itemize}
			\item	Up to 30\% of course grade (assignments and project)
			\item	\emph{Learn with each other}
			\item	Assignments done in groups of 2 or by yourself
			\item	Hand-in assignments as one submission
			\item	Extra credit for 4C3 students if you do the 6C3 questions (where indicated; not always)
			\item	6C3 students: you are held to a higher level of quality
		\end{itemize}
		\item	Late grading
		\begin{itemize}
			\item	\( -30 \)\% per day
			\item	2 ``late day'' credits for assignments
			\item	solutions posted after $\approx 2$ days of due date
		\end{itemize}
		\item	Assignment grading:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item	No make-ups for assignments
			\item	Assignments count {\color{myBlue}\textbf{20\%}} of course grade
			\item	Best $N-1$ assignments ($N \approx 7$) will be used
		\end{itemize}
		\item	Assignment dates: see website
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Group-based assignments}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item	``Appropriate'' group work is highly encouraged (about 30\% of course)
		\item	Learn with each other: groups of 2, no larger
		\vspace{2pt}\hrule\vspace{2pt}
		\item	Optimal group work: \emph{an example of one approach}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item	Sarah and Brad work on an assignment
				\item	Both Sarah and Brad do {\color{myRed}{\textbf{all questions}}} in draft: quick notes at home, on the bus, \emph{etc}, $\pm 4$ days before assignment due
				\pause
				\item	Meet in the library next day and go over each other's notes
				\item	Explain to the other why you disagree
				\item	e.g. Sarah sees a mistaken interpretation in Brad's work
				\begin{itemize}
					\item	She explains why it is a mistake to Brad: Sarah learns
					\item	Brad also learns: he's heard this in class, and from Sarah now
					\item	If neither can resolve it? speak with TA or Kevin
				\end{itemize}
				\pause
				\item	Write up a joint solution; e.g. Sarah Q1 and 2, Brad does Q3
				\item	Both review it before submitting
			\end{itemize}
		\vspace{2pt}\hrule\vspace{2pt}
		\pause
		\item	Other approaches are possible: your group decides
		\item	\color{myOrange}{What doesn't work}: Sarah does Q1 and Q2, Brad does Q3; staple and submit
		\item	\textbf{Do not share files or written work} \emph{between} groups
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{There are weekly tests in this course: why?}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item	\textbf{Fact}: frequent small tests help understand and retain material
		\item	This approach has been successfully used at McMaster in other courses.
		\begin{columns}[t]
			\column{0.70\textwidth}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item	``\emph{{\color{purple}{Testing effect}}}'': probability of remembering a tested item (``an item that has to be recalled from memory'') is greater than an item that was simply \emph{studied}. 
				%Coupled with ``feedback'', this effect can be enhanced (but timing of feedback is important).
				\vspace{12pt}
				\item	``{\color{purple}{Spacing effect}}'': breaks between multiple reviews of material, increasing the duration of the breaks, improves recall.
				\begin{itemize}
					\item	``{\color{myGreen}{\emph{tent-in-the-wind-with-pegs effect}}}''
				\end{itemize}
				\vspace{12pt}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Weekly tests}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item	Testing window: Monday night until Wednesday afternoon (a 40-hour window)
		\item	Test is only about 1 hour in duration, depending on questions
		\item	Covers work reviewed in class
		\item	There will occasionally be questions from prior weeks
		\item	Solutions will be automatically given immediately after the window closes
		\item	Each test counts $\approx$ 1\% of your grades; total of {\color{myBlue}\textbf{13\%}}
		\item	No make-ups; {\color{myGreen}{\textbf{much lower stakes than the midterms}}}
		\item	Any notes, materials, websites, electronic documents are allowed, and encouraged.
		\item	\textbf{\emph{Code of honour}}: you must do the test on your own
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Grading for project and exams}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item	Midterm:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item	{\color{myBlue}\textbf{12\%}} of course grade
			\item	\emph{optional}
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item	Written final exam: {\color{myBlue}\textbf{45\%}}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item	Covers all material
			\item	\textbf{{\color{myRed}{You must achieve 50\% or greater in final exam to pass 4C3/6C3}}}
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item	Midterm and final exam:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item	Open notes -- anything on paper is allowed
			\item	No electronic devices unfortunately
			\item	Any calculator
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item	Experimental report due on 31 March: {\color{myBlue}\textbf{10\%}}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item	Perform you own \emph{designed experiment}
			\item	More details \href{http://learnche.mcmaster.ca/4C3/Designed_experiments_project_-_2014}{on the course website} already
			\item	The earlier you start, the better (start early March)
			\item	You can, and should, provide an outline of your experimental plan for me to review by 10 March
			\item	Can collaborate, \textbf{but only within your group}: not between groups
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
